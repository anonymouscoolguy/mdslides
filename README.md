Try the presentation tool at [slides.md](TODO) and check out the [documentation](TODO) for futher references.

# Acknowledgments

Slides.md is solely the graphical interface connecting the editor and presentation framework together.

The heavy-lifting is done by the following frameworks:

- [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/)
- [Ace](https://ace.c9.io/)
- [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/)
