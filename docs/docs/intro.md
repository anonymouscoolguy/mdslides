# Getting Started

:::info

MDSlides is solely the graphical interface connecting the editor and presentation framework together.

The heavy-lifting is done by the following frameworks:

- [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/)
- [Ace](https://ace.c9.io/)
- [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/)

Let's create our first **markdown presentation** together.

## New Slides

To create a new slide, use `---`.

```md
